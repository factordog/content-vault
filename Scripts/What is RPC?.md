Hey dev. 

Do you know of a interesting way computers can talk to each other? There's a special way called Remote Procedure Call, or RPC for short.

RPC is a way for computers to communicate and execute code remotely. It works by allowing one server to send a request to another server, asking it to perform a specific function or task.

For example, let's say Server A needs to access a database stored on Server B. Server A can use RPC to send a request to Server B, asking it to retrieve the requested data from the database. Server B will then execute the request and send the data back to Server A.

RPC is commonly used in distributed systems, where multiple servers need to work together to perform a task. It allows servers to share resources and information, making it easier to collaborate and get things done.
