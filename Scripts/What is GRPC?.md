Hey dev.

Do you know about RPC? If not make sure to checkout my previous RPC video. Because in this video we are going to talk about GRPC.

gRPC stands for "Google Remote Procedure Call," and it's a modern, open-source, high-performance RPC framework developed by Google. It uses HTTP/2 as the underlying transport and is designed to work efficiently across a variety of environments.

gRPC uses Protocol Buffers, a flexible, high-level interface, to define the structure of the data being transmitted and the operations that can be performed on that data. This allows for efficient serialization and deserialization of data, as well as the ability to generate client and server code automatically in a variety of programming languages.

In short, gRPC is a powerful variant of RPC that is optimized for performance and flexibility, and is used for building efficient, scalable, and reliable distributed systems. So if you want to take your RPC game to the next level, be sure to give gRPC a try!
