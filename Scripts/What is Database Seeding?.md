Hey dev!

Do you know what database seeding is?

If you're a developer, you know the importance of testing your database to ensure it's functioning properly. But manually inputting data every time can be tedious and resetting to previous instances can be a hassle.

That's where database seeding comes in. It's the process of adding your initial "seed" data to your database, which can be useful for testing and development purposes. With database seeding, you can work with a sample dataset without worrying about corrupting real data. 

Plus, it's a quick and easy way to reset your database to a stable point. So next time you need to test your database, consider using database seeding to save time and ensure accuracy.

I have written an article on how you can set this up with Postgres and Docker. Checkout my page links.
